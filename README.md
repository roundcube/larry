INSTALLATION
------------

The skin can be installed by putting the content in a subfolder of the
the Roundcube's `skins` folder or by using composer:
```
composer require "roundcube/larry:~1.6.0"
```
Note: make sure to use version of the skin that matches the Roundcube version.
If it is not available use the closest lower version number. For example,
if your Roundcube version is 1.6.5, use skin version 1.6.x (with max X that exists),
if 1.6.x does not exist use 1.5.x and so on. Using 1.7.x and up might not work.
